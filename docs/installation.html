<h2 id="h1">Installation</h2>

<p>The current release works with both Mozilla Browser and Firefox
on win32 and with linux.

<p>To install mozImage read the <a href="http://mozimage.mozdev.org/releases.html">release notes</a>
and then download the xpi <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/168/">here</a>.</p>

<p>Once installed, a new menu item should appear under MozillaFirefox
tools menu; click on this new menu item to open mozImage sidebar.

<h2 id="h2">Web page analysis</h2>

<p>
There are two ways to open <i>mozImage</i>: through the
tools menu and with the context menu of the current web page.
With this last method mozImage reads the current page in search of links that point
to an image. If the link itself is an image <i>mozImage</i> will display the image on
the left of the link name (you must enable the thumbnails on the options panel).
</p>

<h2 id="h3">Configuring macros</h2>

This release of mozImage offers the possibility of creating some <i>macros</i>. This macros
allow you to use <i>external applications</i> to enhanche mozImage. For example you can use
<a href="http://www.imagemagick.org/">ImageMagick</a> to rotate or resize an image.
If you go to the "macro|Config macro" menu, you will find a configuration panel that allows you to create
your own macros. This panel consists of two columns: <i>name</i> and <i>macro</i>. In the "name" column
you can insert a symbolic name, for example "Rotate 90°", while in the "macro" column you must write
the <i>command line</i> to run the external application, for example:</p>

<pre>'C:\Program files\ImageMagick6\convert.exe' %f -rotate 90 %f</pre>

If the application name contains some spaces, it’s important to enclose its path in quotes. In
this example the %f will be replaced by the name of the current image. See also the
<a href="http://mozimage.mozdev.org/screenshots.html">Screen shots</a>.

<h2 id="h4">Bookmarks</h2>

<p>
The bookmarks concept is much like that of a browser: when you are seeing the
images inside a folder you can click on the "add bookmark" button and that folder will
go to your bookmarks.
</p>
<p>
The bookmarks are stored on a file named <i>mozimage-bookmarks.txt</i> on your
profile directory, with name and directory separated by a new line.
</p>

<h2 id="h5">MozImage edit</h2>

<p>This module was developed by <a href="http://mozimage.mozdev.org/credits.html">
My Hoang</a> and offers you the possibility to modify images throught
<a href="http://www.imagemagick.org/">ImageMagick</a>. So you must first install
<i>ImageMagick</i> then open the <i>options panel</i> of <i>MozImage</i> and fill
the voice named "Path to convert" with the main executable of ImageMagick, for
examples:

<pre>
C:\Program files\ImageMagick6\convert.exe
</pre>
